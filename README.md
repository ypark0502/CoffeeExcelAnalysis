# Coffee Excel Data Analysis and Dashboard
**Business Task**: This project involves developing an interactive sales dashboard for a fictious coffee dataset of 1000 unique coffee orders and 50 unique coffee products.

**Technologies**: Microsoft Excel (XLOOKUP, IF, INDEX, MATCH, PIVOT TABLES, SLICERS, TIMELINE, BAR AND LINE CHARTS)
## Process
* Use functions like XLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH, and also IF statements to create additional columns in the "orders" tab using data from other tabs
  * Such as Email, Country, Coffee Type, Unit Price, Sales, etc.
  * For Sales column, perform basic multiplication of unit price and quantity to get sales dollar amount
* Format dates and numbers to make numbers less ambiguous
  * This includes formatting sales to be in USD, size to be in kg, etc.
* Clean data in Excel by going to Data tab and checking for duplicates
* Convert the Range to a Table to provide data source for Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts
* Create various Pivot Tables and Charts in separate sheets and customize visuals using formatting
* Organize Pivot Charts into dashboard
